Finding the right level for you
Once you’ve booked your English course we’ll do a simple assessment of your language levels. This is very important as it helps us make sure we select the perfect class for you – one with students at the same level. <br> <br>

This ensures that our English classes aren’t too hard or too easy. And as each course has been expertly tailored for students at that level, our excellent teachers will help you to become fluent in English as quickly as possible. <br><br>

As you learn English you can move up to different class to make sure that you’re always at the right level. <br> <br>

Every month you will receive a progress report detailing how your English has improved. We monitor your progress using regular progressing testing so you can see just how much better you’re getting and identify the areas you need to work on. Whatever your level we’ll be here to help you every step of the way. <br> <br>
